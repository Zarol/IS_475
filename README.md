# IS_475
Project files for the IS 475 Database Design and Implementation course (Spring 2016).

The purpose of this course is to enhance your knowledge of database design, creation, and implementation. This course combines conceptual knowledge of database management systems (DBMS) with practical, hands-on skills using Microsoft’s SQL Server DBMS. At the end of this course you will know or be able to do the following:  
1. Design a database that is stable and understand why your design is stable. You will use the normalization process to facilitate database design.  
2. Use entity-relationship diagrams (ERD's) to depict the design of a database. Use ERD’s to communicate design concepts with both technical and non-technical people.  
3. Implement a database using Microsoft’s SQL Server DBMS with structured query language (SQL) to create, update, and access data in a database.  
4. Identify the objectives and design goals of a transaction database versus a data warehouse.  
5. Describe the general components of a database management system.  
6. Describe the job activities that are the responsibilities of a database administrator.
